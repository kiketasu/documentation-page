            <h3>üî∑Skills and Perks</h3>
            <p>The system is based on 18 skills that improve through use. When leveling up, you can unlock "perks" or special upgrades in skill trees, allowing you to specialize in combat, magic, or stealth.</p>
            <h3>‚öîÔ∏èCombat</h3>
            <p>Combat takes place in real time, allowing the use of weapons (one-handed, two-handed, bows, and shields) and spells. The mechanics allow switching between light and heavy attacks, blocks, and finishing moves.</p>
            <h3>ü•∑üèªStealth</h3>
            <p>The stealth system rewards discretion: moving undetected enables sneak attacks, which deal critical damage. It's ideal for players who prefer strategy and surprise.</p>
            <h3>üîÆMagic</h3>
            <p>There are several schools (Destruction, Restoration, Illusion, Alteration, Conjuration) and over 80 spells. Players can assign spells to each hand and customize their loadout, allowing for a blend of magic and physical combat.</p>
            <h3>üßåCreature and NPC System</h3>
            <p>The world is populated by numerous creatures and NPCs that interact dynamically via the Radiant AI system. Each inhabitant has their own routine and reacts to the player's actions, enhancing immersion.</p>
            <h3>‚öñÔ∏èEconomy and Trade System</h3>
            <p>Each city and town has its own economy; players can buy, sell, and even forge weapons and armor in smithies. Transactions and the ability to trade ingredients and items make resource management essential.</p>

            <h3>üõ°Ô∏èFactions and Guilds</h3>
            <p>The game offers multiple factions (thieves' guilds, companions, mages, among others) that provide quests, rewards, and parallel narratives, allowing the player to choose their path and affiliation.</p>
            <h3>ü§ñAI and Radiant AI</h3>
